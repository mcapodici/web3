Web 3 is my collection of examples where a website connects to the Ethereum network.

## Notes

### Initial creation of project

The project was created using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started), initiated with the command: `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`

TODO:

* Detect if metamask is offering no acconuts (e.g. password not entered and show message)
* A neater way to display messages
* Detect if not on Rinkby since I don't want to deploy to all testnets or mainnet
